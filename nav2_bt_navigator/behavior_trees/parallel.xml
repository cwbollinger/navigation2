<!--
  This Behavior Tree implements continuous execution of the global planner (ComputePathToPose).

  The rate at which the ComputePathToPose operation is invoked can be controlled with
  the hz parameter to the RateController node. By default, the global plan is updated once
  per second.

  The ComputePathToPose node is wrapped by a RateController node that controls how
  often the path is recomputed. The Sequence node first executes the RateController branch.
  The RateController returns RUNNING while it is waiting for the next time interval to expire. 
  Once it expires, the RateController ticks the ComputePathToPose and returns the result.

  Follow path retrieves the path from the blackboard, detecting whether the path has been updated.
